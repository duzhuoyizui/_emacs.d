   No any /vi(m)/ extension(plugin or key binding), I'm not a Vim user, thinking by emacs way.

   Leader key include =M-s=, =<f9>=, =<f8>=, easy remember.

   - =M-s= most for left hand start, right hand end;
   - =<f9>= most for right hand start, left hand end;
   - =<f8>= only for =projectile= package;
